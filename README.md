1. Link to your hosted game in the URL section of your Github repo.
  url: http://tina513.github.io/game-project-client;

2. List technologies used.
  Data structure: Game elements stored in an JavaScript array; All the data exchange format stored on JSON format; Player send requests to server by AJAX; 

3.Document your planning and tell a story about your development process and problem-solving strategy.
  At the beginning of this project, I spent a day on game-logic part and mainly focused on js functions.
  And after I successfully played tic-tac-toe on local, I started to made some AJAX request to store game information into the database. After completing basic requirements, I added some extra functions on my game to made it more user-friendly, such as combining sign-up with log-in function, checking similarity of password and password-conformation,etc. And after that, I focused on UI design for making it visually appealing. But not every parts went smoothly. When I came across some tricky problems, I started to spend limited time for solving it, if I couldn't solve it in that time-frame, I diverted to other parts of the project. So in a time-efficienct manner, my problem-solving strategy is to approach your problem asychronizely, not synchronizely.

4.List unsolved problems which would be fixed in future iterations.
  I planed to design a hard level human vs robot function.
  Robot can predict user's next move and then respond it accordingly.
  But because of tight schedule, I only designed a easy level competition.
  I am planning to approach this problem in the future.

5.Link to wireframes and user stories.
